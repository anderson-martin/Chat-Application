# Chat-Application
### Chat Client and Chat Server written in Java
I have read the book Head First Java. As part of assignments, I have developed a simple chat server and chat client. I have pushed them in two separate branches.

I developed them modular (to make maintenance easier) and also annotated them for clarification.
